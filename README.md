# Finances-Maratona-Discovery

This project is my first ever programing project. It is a pretty simple site to keep track of your incomes and expenses.

## Overview

The project was developed during the bootcamp Maratona Discovery organized by the plataform Rocketseat. It is a basic single page site done with the 
bare minimum of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without any type of library or that sort of thing. 

The app consist in a site where you can put your expenses and incomes list and it will show you the balance sum for all your transactions added.

## Build Process

The site structure is really simple, with only one file for the each thing (HTML, CSS and JS). On top of the project developed during the bootcamp I 
added a darkmode and tweaked the colors.

## How to run it

To run this you only need to clone the repository and open the html file in your browser.
